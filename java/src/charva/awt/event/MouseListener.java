 * <P>
 * The listener object created from that class is then registered with a

 * method. In Charva, a mouse event is generated when the mouse is clicked.
 * Unlike Swing, a mouse event is NOT generated when the mouse cursor enters
 * or leaves a component. When a mouse event
 * occurs, the relevant method in the listener object is invoked, and
 * the <code>MouseEvent</code> is passed to it.
